# OR-NMT
### Source code for the paper &lt;Bridging the Gap between Training and Inference for Neural Machine Translation>

Codes in the two directories are the OR-NMT system based on the RNNsearch and Transformer Models correspondingly
+ based on the RNNsearch system which we implemented from scratch
+ based on the Transformer system [fairseq](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq) implemented by Facebook
