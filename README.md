# OR-NMT
### Source code for the paper &lt;Bridging the Gap between Training and Inference for Neural Machine Translation>

Codes in the two directories are the OR-NMT systems based on the RNNsearch and Transformer models correspondingly
+ OR-RNNsearch: based on the RNNsearch system which we implemented from scratch
+ OR-Transformer: based on the Transformer system [fairseq](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq) implemented by Facebook
+ \>= Pytorch 1.2.0
